Bounce rate analysis is an important aspect of understanding user behavior on a website. 
Bounce rate refers to the percentage of visitors who leave a website after viewing only a single page,
without interacting further or navigating to other pages within the site.

-- STEP 2: identifying the landing page of each session
-- STEP 3: counting pageviews for each session, to identify "bounces"
